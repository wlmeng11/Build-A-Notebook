# Build-A-Notebook
This repository contains the design files, Bill of Materials (BoM), and instructions for my Build-A-Notebook seminar that I held in the Columbia Makerspace on November 10, 2018.

# Instructions
## Lasercutting
There are 3 parts that need to be lasercut:
* covers (1/8" acrylic)
* inserts (1/16” acrylic)
* spine templates (cardstock)

Each notebook will need 2 covers and 2 inserts, so to make 100 notebooks we’ll need 200 each.
Each table will need at least 1 spine template, so let’s make 10 or so.

Covers
* In Thunder Laser, [set the imported DXF units to Inches](https://www.thunderlaser.com/troubleshooting/software-problem/why-does-the-graphic-size-that-imported-to-rdworks-different-from-its-original-size.html).
* Import DXF file: **Notebook cover 24x12.dxf**
* Prepare the material: **1/8" acrylic, 24x12” sheet**
* Set power and speed
* Min power: 75
* Max power: 95
* Speed: 10
* Align laser head to top left corner of material, and make sure material is not rotated relative to the bed.
* Begin cutting.

Inserts
